Prediction of roof labels given satellites pictures of houses
The task at hand can be identified as an image segmentation problem. Therefore a U-net architecture (see here for more info on the U_net model) was used in order to train the model. The motivation to this choice of architecture is that it was designed to give good results when only a small number of training images are available. Moreover, is computationally fast. Below are the steps taken to solve the given problem.
